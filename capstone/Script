introduction:
Moe "Hi I'm Moe, i was the Navigator"
Chris "And i'm chris, i was the driver"

Design(Chris): created DollarAmount, Inventory, Product, and Main classes while
adding onto the VendingMachineCLI and Menu classes (show new classes, and additions
to original classes) hand over to Moe to demo the program and tests



Demo(Moe): Run program from Main, display inventory, enter purchase menu,
feed money, select product, finish transaction, enter secret menu option (0)

show transactionlog.txt, and salesreportlog.csv


Chris:
if asked to run tests, remove System. from line 68 in Menu.java class show
failed tests visibly pass, failed due to windows formatting


Closing Comments:
Originally we attempted to write this project completely from scratch
but about mid way through things spiraled out of control with too many classes and
having difficulty with calling methods from other classes, so we went back to the
original code which taught us sometimes staring from scratch first isnt always the best idea

questions comments concerns?
